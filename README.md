# SharePointWork
I am currently working on some SharePoint functionality for a client. This is the initial git repository setup read me text file.
What has been completed and tested
1) Created a constants class in the Helpers folder
2) Created a metadata class in the Helpers folder
3) The metadata class contains two methods : CreateSiteColumns and CreateContentTypeAndAddSiteColumn
4) Created a Columns.xml cofig file and added it to the project's SharePoint Layouts folder
5) Created an event receiver that calls the the two methods created in step 3 above.
6) Created declarative lists - Published Documents and Draft Documents
7) 2017/12/21 - Test the creation of the lists and association of the content type before moving on to the next task which is the workflow.
